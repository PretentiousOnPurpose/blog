                        So here’s something I know to be true, although it’s a little corny, and I don’t quite know what to do with it:
                        What I regret most in my life are failures of kindness.
                        Those moments when another human being was there, in front of me, suffering and I responded… sensibly. Reservedly. Mildly.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Or, to look at it from the other end of the telescope: Who, in your life, do you remember most fondly, with the most undeniable feelings of warmth?
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Those who were kindest to you, I bet.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        It’s a little facile, maybe, and certainly hard to implement, but I’d say, as a goal in life, you could do worse than: Try to be kinder.                    </p>

                        Years ago, my mother used to say to me, she’d say “In this world, Elwood, you must be oh so so smart, or oh so pleasant.” Well, for years I was smart… I recommend pleasant.

                <p class="postShortContent">I often feel as though I get too excited about trivial things. They make me extremely happy as well as sad. I find myself head over heels when someone includes me in a plan, or remembers my favourite dessert or calls in to check on me. My happiness peaks higher than the Himalayas. The same thing happens with sadness – betrayals, failures, or anything negative in general, leaves me gloomy for a long time. </p>

That curiosity, happiness, energy, and excitement of witnessing this world that they find themselves in. Kids learn a lot while they are kids and repeat those things in some or the other form when they become adults.</p>
