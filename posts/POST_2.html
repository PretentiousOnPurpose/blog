                        I often feel as though I get too excited about trivial things. They make me extremely happy as well as sad. I find myself head over heels when someone includes me in a plan, or remembers my favourite dessert or calls in to check on me. My happiness peaks higher than the Himalayas. The same thing happens with sadness – betrayals, failures, or anything negative in general, leaves me gloomy for a long time.  The feedback I receive most commonly is that these things are pretty naive or “trivial” and that my emotional responses are not justified, even more so because I am a guy and that guys are not supposed to be a “lot emotional”.

                        All of this makes me feel as though I am still a kid or a baby, still early in his life and without much experience. And maybe that is true, maybe I am a kid in an adult body. I lack the rich experiences of life – love and joy – which everyone takes for granted – not realizing that some of us are yet to have a sip because of life’s inherent unfairness. I sense that judgement and eye roll from people on a daily basis, even from those I considered friends. Maybe the trivial isn’t trivial for me – maybe your trivial isn’t my trivial – maybe my trivial isn’t your trivial. Our trivials are trivials because we have already experienced them fully or to a good enough extent in our lives or to put it the other way around, not everyone has experienced the “trivial” for it to be their trivial. That’s a lot of trivial right there 🙂

                        For me, the thing that still makes smile with tears of joy is a friendship that made me feel the most purest form of love – Acceptance. And on the other side of the coin is a betrayal  – from people I considered “friends” – that aches my heart to this day. I used to feel a lot of rage for revenge and sadness to cry for a long time – as though I lost something valuable there. People often tell me that they have seen someone going through much worse and that I shouldn’t feel so bad. I have with no response for that. I mean, yes, there are people who have it worse but why does that negate my pain?
                        <br><br>
                        
                        I am not advocating that we must not let go and not move on with our lives but moving on isn’t possible if we trivialize our emotions. We feel our emotions through our inner child and It doesn’t matter if someone else has had it worse in their life, that betrayal was hurtful and trivializing that betrayal will only hurt the inner child even more. Accepting our emotions consoles the inner child and acknowledges the hurt and pain. It took me quite a while to understand this – because it wasn’t trivial to me – even though it is to many :/
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Our inner child guides our emotional experiences and every child is different, grown up in different environments with different resources and different nutrition. Maybe judgy eyes isn’t the best sight for that kid. Acceptance has been the key for me, be it people or me or my emotions, accepting them for what they are brings in peace and space for love (that’s a cliche, I know). We aren’t judging when we accept someone for who they are and that for me, is the highest form of love and I am head over heels to have experienced that. And I know for a fact that it is not a trivial thing in this cynical world, especially, that too in a friendship with the opposite gender :’)
